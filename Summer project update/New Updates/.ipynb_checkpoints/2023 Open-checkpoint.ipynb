    "We will use the standard formula for sample size calculation for hypothesis testing about proportions. The sample size (n) for detecting a difference of $\\Delta$ with power $1 - \\beta$ and significance level $\\alpha$ can be derived using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.\n",

    "**F-test Formula:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$F = \\frac{s^2_1}{s^2_2}$\n",

    "From the PROC TTEST output, the variances or standard deviations will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming we have the output, we check if the F-value is significant at $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value from the F-test is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of equal variances. Otherwise, we reject it.\n",

    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "If the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the mean age at which infants from populations A and B walked alone. The confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the true mean difference.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "To determine if the four filling machines are consistent in filling 12 oz cough syrup bottles by analyzing the variance among them using an appropriate statistical model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part (a) Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given Data:**\n",
    "- The weight of cough syrup filled in bottles by four different machines.\n",
    "- 5 runs for each machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Selection:**\n",
    "Given the data structure, where we have measurements from multiple groups (machines), an **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)** model is appropriate. Specifically, a **One-Way ANOVA** will be used to determine if there are any statistically significant differences between the means of the weights filled by the different machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason:**\n",
    "ANOVA is used to compare means across multiple groups to see if at least one group mean is different from the others, which is suitable for testing the consistency of the machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$Y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\epsilon_{ij}$\n",

    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "1. **Independence:** The observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "2. **Normality:** The residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) should be approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "3. **Homogeneity of Variances (Homoscedasticity):** The variances among the different groups should be approximately equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check Assumptions Using Output:**\n",
    "- **Normality:** Can be checked using a Q-Q plot or a normality test (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test).\n",
    "- **Homogeneity of Variances:** Can be checked using Levene's test or Bartlett's test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Output:**\n",
    "If these assumptions are met, proceed with the ANOVA. If not, consider transforming the data or using a non-parametric test like the Kruskal-Wallis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part (c) Hypothesis Testing Using ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:**\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** All machines fill bottles with the same mean weight ($\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3 = \\mu_4$).\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$):** At least one machine fills bottles with a different mean weight.\n",

    "   - **Page 5:** Could show detailed group means and standard deviations.\n",
    "   - **Page 6:** Might include post-hoc tests indicating which machines are significantly different.\n",
    "   - **Page 7:** Could have residual plots or other diagnostic checks.\n",

    "### Problem 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "Analyze the relationship between advertising revenue and other factors for US magazines using multiple linear regression models. Specifically, assess the validity of the initial model, consider transformations, and interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part (a): Assessing the Validity of Model (1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model (1):**\n",
    "\n",
    "$Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_3 + \\varepsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- Y = AdRevenue (in thousands of \\$)\n",
    "- $x_1$ = AdPages\n",
    "- $x_2$ = SubRevenue (in thousands of \\$)\n",
    "- $x_3$ = NewsRevenue (in thousands of \\$)\n",
    "- $\\varepsilon$ = Error term assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance $\\sigma^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assessing Validity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine if Model (1) is valid, we need to check if it meets the assumptions of multiple linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity:** The relationship between each predictor and the response variable is linear.\n",
    "2. **Independence:** The residuals (errors) are independent.\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity:** The residuals have constant variance.\n",
    "4. **Normality:** The residuals are normally distributed.\n",
    "5. **No Multicollinearity:** The predictors are not highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity Check:**\n",
    "   - **Scatterplots:** Plot each predictor ($x_1, x_2, x_3$) against the response variable Y. If the plots show a linear trend, the linearity assumption holds.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Independence Check:**\n",
    "   - **Study Design:** If the data collection process ensures independence (e.g., different magazines), this assumption is likely satisfied.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity Check:**\n",
    "   - **Residual Plots:** Plot residuals vs. fitted values. If the spread of residuals is constant across all levels of fitted values, homoscedasticity holds.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Normality Check:**\n",
    "   - **Q-Q Plot:** Plot the quantiles of the residuals against the quantiles of a normal distribution. If the points fall approximately along a straight line, normality holds.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Multicollinearity Check:**\n",
    "   - **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):** Calculate VIF for each predictor. VIF values greater than 10 indicate high multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Issues:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the variables involve monetary amounts and counts (e.g., AdPages), it's common for such data to exhibit skewness, especially monetary variables. If the residuals show non-linearity, heteroscedasticity, or non-normality, the model may not be valid without transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part (b): Considering Log Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:**\n",
    "A statistician suggests applying a log transformation to Y and all predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale for Log Transformation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stabilize Variance:**\n",
    "   - Monetary variables often have increasing variance with increasing mean (heteroscedasticity). Log transformation can stabilize variance.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Normalize Distribution:**\n",
    "   - Skewed data can be made more symmetric and closer to normal distribution via log transformation.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Linearize Relationships:**\n",
    "   - If the relationship between variables is multiplicative or exponential, log transformation can linearize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assessment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the nature of the data (revenues and counts), it is likely that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AdRevenue, SubRevenue, NewsRevenue:** These are monetary variables, potentially right-skewed.\n",
    "- **AdPages:** Counts, may also be skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, applying a log transformation is reasonable to address potential violations of regression assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "Agree with the recommendation to apply log transformations, leading to Model (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part (c): Validity of Model (2) Using Residual Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model (2):**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\log(Y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(x_1) + \\beta_2 \\log(x_2) + \\beta_3 \\log(x_3) + \\varepsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assessing Validity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using residual plots is essential to evaluate the assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Residuals vs. Fitted Values:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Check for homoscedasticity and linearity.\n",
    "   - **Interpretation:** Look for random scatter around zero with no clear patterns.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Normal Q-Q Plot:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Assess normality of residuals.\n",
    "   - **Interpretation:** Points should lie close to the 45-degree line.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scale-Location Plot:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Further check for homoscedasticity.\n",
    "   - **Interpretation:** Points should be randomly scattered.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Residuals vs. Leverage:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Identify influential observations.\n",
    "   - **Interpretation:** Points with high leverage and large residuals may unduly influence the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the residual plots after log transformation show:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No patterns or funnels** in Residuals vs. Fitted Values,\n",
    "- **Residuals aligned** along the line in the Q-Q plot,\n",
    "  \n",
    "then Model (2) is valid as it satisfies regression assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part (d): Identifying Statistically Significant Variables in Model (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regression Output:**\n",
    "   - Use statistical software (e.g., SAS, R) to fit Model (2) and obtain regression coefficients, standard errors, t-values, and p-values.\n",

    "**Coefficients:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **log(AdPages) ($\\hat{\\beta}_1 = 0.800$):**\n",
    "   - **Interpretation:** A 1% increase in AdPages is associated with an average **0.8% increase** in AdRevenue, holding other factors constant.\n",

    "2. **log(SubRevenue) ($\\hat{\\beta}_2 = 0.150$):**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note:** The coefficient for log(NewsRevenue) is not significant; thus, we refrain from interpreting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If AdPages increase by 10%, AdRevenue is expected to increase by $0.8 \\times 10\\% = 8\\%$.\n",
    "- If SubRevenue increases by 10%, AdRevenue is expected to increase by $0.15 \\times 10\\% = 1.5\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "AdPages have a strong positive association with AdRevenue, indicating that more advertising pages contribute significantly to advertising revenue. SubRevenue also has a positive but smaller effect. NewsRevenue does not have a statistically significant association with AdRevenue in this model.\n",

    "\n",
    "The least squares estimates for the regression line indicate a significant positive relationship between the boiling point of water and the log of atmospheric pressure. The error variance is small, suggesting a good fit of the model. The 95% confidence interval for the slope $\\beta_1$ suggests that for each unit increase in boiling point, the log atmospheric pressure increases by between 0.8598 and 0.9314 units. This result is statistically significant, confirming that the boiling point is a reliable predictor of atmospheric pressure."
