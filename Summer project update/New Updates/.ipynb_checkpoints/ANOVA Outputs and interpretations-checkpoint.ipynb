    "### Image 1: Boxplot for Distribution of Response\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Understand the distribution of the response variable across different levels of Factor A.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given Data:** The boxplot displays the response variable across three levels of Factor A (A1, A2, A3).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **A1:** The median response is around 6, with a somewhat symmetric distribution. The interquartile range (IQR) indicates a moderate spread of the data.\n",
    "- **A2:** The median response is around 8, slightly higher than A1. The distribution seems more compact, with less variability as indicated by a smaller IQR.\n",
    "- **A3:** The median response is around 10, the highest among the three levels. The data distribution is symmetric with a small IQR, suggesting low variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** The response increases from A1 to A3, and variability decreases as the response increases, especially from A2 to A3.\n",

    "### Image 2: Tukey's HSD Test\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Determine which means among the different levels of Factor A are significantly different from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given Data:**\n",
    "- **Alpha:** 0.05\n",
    "- **Error Degrees of Freedom:** 12\n",
    "- **Error Mean Square:** 0.052222\n",
    "- **Critical Value:** 3.77289\n",
    "- **Minimum Significant Difference (MSD):** 0.352\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **Grouping:** The Tukey HSD test shows that Factor A3 has a significantly higher mean response than A2 and A1, as indicated by the distinct groups.\n",
    "- **Estimates:** A3 has the highest mean estimate (9.85), followed by A2 (7.85), and A1 (5.82). Since the means are not covered by the same bar, they are significantly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** The response for A3 is significantly higher than for A2 and A1, and A2 is significantly higher than A1.\n",

    "### Image 3: Interaction Plot for Response\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Examine the interaction between Factor A and Factor B on the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given Data:**\n",
    "- The plot shows responses across three levels of Factor A (A1, A2, A3) for two levels of Factor B (B1, B2).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **Parallel Lines:** The lines are not perfectly parallel, indicating an interaction between Factor A and Factor B.\n",
    "- **B1 vs. B2:** For both B1 and B2, the response increases with the levels of Factor A, but the increase is more pronounced for B2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** There is an interaction between Factor A and Factor B, with Factor B2 amplifying the response as Factor A increases.\n",

    "### Image 4: GLM Procedure for Least Squares Means\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Analyze the least squares means for the interaction between Factor A and Factor B.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given Data:**\n",
    "- **Response LSMEANS:** Displays the least squares means (LSMEAN) for combinations of Factor A and Factor B.\n",
    "- **P-values:** The table shows p-values for pairwise comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **Significance:** All pairwise comparisons have p-values less than 0.05, indicating significant differences between each combination of Factor A and Factor B.\n",
    "- **LSMEAN Differences:** The differences in LSMEANS are all statistically significant, indicating that the interaction between Factor A and Factor B significantly affects the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** The interaction between Factor A and Factor B has a significant impact on the response, with distinct differences across all combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![LS-Means for Factor A*B](ls_means_plot.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image 5: LS-Means for FactorA*FactorB\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Visualize the least squares means for the interaction between Factor A and Factor B.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given Data:** \n",
    "- The plot displays the least squares means for each combination of Factor A and Factor B.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **Pattern:** The plot shows increasing LS-means across levels of Factor A for each level of Factor B. The increase is more pronounced for B2 compared to B1.\n",
    "- **Response Differences:** A3B2 combination has the highest response, while A1B1 has the lowest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** The combination of Factor A and Factor B has a strong interaction effect, with A3B2 yielding the highest response and A1B1 the lowest.\n",
    "\n",
    "These interpretations provide a detailed understanding of how Factors A and B interact to influence the response variable.\n"
