    "### Problem 3(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Determine if the plot of mean weight gain at each treatment level by TB status indicates a statistically significant interaction effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plot Analysis:** If the plot provided shows non-parallel lines between the treatment levels (Thalidomide vs. Placebo) for different TB statuses (Positive vs. Negative), it suggests an interaction effect. Specifically, if the lines cross or diverge significantly, it would indicate that the effect of thalidomide on weight gain differs depending on whether the individual is TB positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conclusion:** If the plot shows a clear divergence or crossing of lines, we would expect a statistically significant interaction effect when we examine the F-test results in the next part of the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 3(ii)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Report the F-test value and p-value for the treatment by TB status interaction effect, and test the hypothesis $H_0$: No interaction between treatment and TB status.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given Data (Assumed from the output):**\n",

    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hypothesis Testing:** \n",
    "  - If the **p-value** for the interaction term is less than 0.05 (or another significance level), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant interaction effect between treatment and TB status on weight gain.\n",
    "  - If the **p-value** is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating no significant interaction effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conclusion:** Based on the actual p-value provided in the output, you'll determine if the interaction effect is statistically significant. This conclusion should be consistent with the visual analysis of the plot in part (i).\n",

    "### Problem 3(iii)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Decide whether to perform the main effects tests after assessing the interaction effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasoning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interaction Effect Significant:** \n",
    "  - If the interaction effect is significant (p-value < 0.05), the main effects of treatment and TB status should be interpreted with caution because the interaction suggests that the effect of one factor depends on the level of the other factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interaction Effect Not Significant:**\n",
    "  - If the interaction effect is not significant (p-value > 0.05), it is appropriate to proceed with the main effects tests, which would provide information on the individual effects of treatment and TB status on weight gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** The decision here depends on the result from part (ii). If you found a significant interaction effect, the main effects might not be individually meaningful without considering the interaction. If the interaction is not significant, proceed with the main effects analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Given Data (Assumed from the output):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Tukey-Kramer test results would typically show pairwise comparisons between different groups (e.g., Thalidomide with TB positive vs. Placebo with TB negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Significant Differences:** \n",
    "  - Identify which pairs of groups have statistically significant differences in mean weight gain. This is typically indicated by a p-value or a confidence interval that does not include zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Direction of Differences:** \n",
    "  - The direction of the difference tells you whether one treatment group had a higher or lower mean weight gain compared to another. For example, if Thalidomide with TB positive shows a significantly higher weight gain than Placebo with TB negative, this would be an important finding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** The interpretation here involves listing out the significant pairwise differences and discussing what these differences mean in the context of the treatment and TB status effects on weight gain.\n",
