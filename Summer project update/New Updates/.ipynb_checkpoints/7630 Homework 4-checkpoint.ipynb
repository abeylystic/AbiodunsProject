    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "To determine if there is an interaction effect between current smoking status and BMI on systolic blood pressure using the Framingham Heart Study dataset.\n",

    "# Confidence intervals for coefficients\n",

    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "Compare the results of the baseline and interaction models to understand how the interpretation of the effect of smoking and BMI changes when considering their interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- In the baseline model, the effect of smoking and BMI on systolic blood pressure is considered independently.\n",
    "- In the interaction model, the presence of an interaction term allows the effect of BMI on systolic blood pressure to differ based on smoking status.\n",
    "- This comparison can help identify whether the effect of BMI on systolic blood pressure is significantly modified by smoking status.\n",

    "### Problem 12: Influence of Leverage Points in Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "Discuss how leverage points influence the fitted linear regression model, including their impact on the slope, intercept, and the overall fit of the model. Provide an example using R code to illustrate the effect of a leverage point on a simple linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "**Leverage Points** are data points that have an unusually large influence on the fit of the regression model. These points have extreme values for the predictor variable(s) and can significantly affect the slope and intercept of the regression line. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Leverage Points:** These are points that are far from the mean of the predictor variable. They have the potential to \"pull\" the regression line towards themselves, which can result in a biased model fit if they are not representative of the general trend in the data.\n",
    "- **Impact on Slope and Intercept:** If a high leverage point is consistent with the overall trend, it can stabilize the regression line. However, if it is an outlier, it can distort the slope and intercept, leading to incorrect inferences.\n",
    "- **Influence on Fit:** Leverage points can also impact diagnostic measures such as R-squared and p-values, often making the model appear better or worse than it actually is.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Using R Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "# Load necessary libraries\n",
    "library(ggplot2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simulate data\n",
    "set.seed(123)\n",

    "# Add a leverage point\n",
    "x <- c(x, 10)  # Adding a point far from the mean of x\n",
    "y <- c(y, 20)  # Corresponding y value\n",

    "  theme_minimal()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation and Interpretation:\n",
    "1. **Simulate Data:** The code generates 100 random points following a simple linear relationship.\n",
    "2. **Add Leverage Point:** A single point with a large x-value is added to create a high leverage point.\n",
    "3. **Fit Models:** Two linear models are fitted: one without the leverage point and one with it.\n",
    "4. **Compare Models:** The summaries of the models show the impact of the leverage point on the slope, intercept, and overall fit of the model.\n",
    "5. **Plot:** The plot visually shows the effect of the leverage point by comparing the regression line with and without the leverage point. The red line (without leverage) and blue line (with leverage) demonstrate how the leverage point can skew the regression line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "Leverage points can have a profound impact on the regression model.
