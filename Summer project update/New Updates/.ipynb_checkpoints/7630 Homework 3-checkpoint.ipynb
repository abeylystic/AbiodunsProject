    "### Summary of EDA Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "The exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Framingham Heart Study dataset revealed several key insights into the relationships between variables and the distribution of the data. Firstly, the correlation matrix indicated moderate positive correlations between systolic blood pressure (sysBP) and total cholesterol (totChol), as well as between systolic and diastolic blood pressure (diaBP), which is expected given the physiological relationships between these metrics. However, correlations among other variables were generally low, suggesting that multicollinearity may not be a significant issue in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scatterplots provided visual evidence of a slight positive relationship between total cholesterol and systolic blood pressure. This relationship persisted across different gender groups and smoking statuses, though the strength of the association appeared to vary. For example, male participants and smokers exhibited a somewhat stronger correlation between cholesterol and blood pressure compared to their female and non-smoking counterparts, which may indicate the presence of interaction effects between gender, smoking status, and cholesterol levels on blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boxplots stratified by gender and smoking status showed that smokers tend to have higher systolic blood pressure than non-smokers, and this trend was more pronounced in males. Additionally, the histograms of the continuous variables, such as BMI and glucose, revealed some degree of skewness, particularly in variables like cigsPerDay and glucose, suggesting that transformations or non-parametric methods might be necessary for accurate modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the EDA highlighted the importance of considering gender and smoking status as potential moderators in the relationship between cholesterol and blood pressure. The presence of outliers and skewed distributions in certain variables also suggests the need for careful handling of these issues in subsequent modeling efforts."

    "   - **Objective:** Assess whether the residuals follow a normal distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "The full linear regression model examining the relationship between systolic blood pressure (sysBP) and total cholesterol (totChol), while adjusting for BMI, smoking status, age, gender, glucose levels, and heart rate, has provided several key insights. Total cholesterol was found to have a significant positive association with systolic blood pressure, even after controlling for the other covariates in the model. This suggests that higher cholesterol levels are associated with increased systolic blood pressure, an important factor in cardiovascular risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inclusion of BMI, smoking status, age, and glucose levels also significantly improved the model, with each variable showing a strong association with systolic blood pressure. For example, BMI and age were positively associated with higher blood pressure, which aligns with existing medical knowledge. Current smokers were found to have significantly higher systolic blood pressure compared to non-smokers, emphasizing the cardiovascular risks associated with smoking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagnostic analysis indicated that while the model generally fits the data well, some potential violations of model assumptions were observed, such as mild heteroscedasticity and possible non-normality of residuals. These issues, while not severely undermining the model, suggest that there might be room for further refinement, possibly through transformations or alternative modeling approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the model demonstrates a strong and statistically significant association between cholesterol and systolic blood pressure, confirming the importance of monitoring and managing cholesterol levels to prevent hypertension. However, to enhance the robustness of the findings, especially given the mild violations of assumptions, exploring alternative models or transformations could be beneficial. Overall, the current model provides a solid foundation for understanding the determinants of systolic blood pressure in the Framingham Heart Study dataset."
